Some signals (presumable closer or more on-axis) show a strong peak at 80 kHz, a second peak at 52 kHz, and a strong null at about 62 kHz. These may appear in the same event as 44-48kHz pulses (see above). No evidence of “sorting hat” in Wigner.\n\n\nAgain two peaks (green, same group as above). In this case, the lower peak is loudest. Inconspicuous “sorting hat” look to wigner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeak:36 kHz\nNull: NA\nIPI:0.25-0.33\nPPS:3-4\n\nPeak frequency is ~36kHz (similar to Ziphius) but with a very steep decline in amplitudes at lower frequencies (left of the peak). This very clear one shows a secondary peak at 25 kHz, but that is 20dB below the peak and is not likely to be seen in a lower SNR signal. Wigner plot is slightly concave upward, with no sign of “kickstand”.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPeak:34kHz, 50 kHz\nNull: 37kHz\nIPI: 0.125-0.166\nPPS: 6-8\n\nBW37V template (green) shows two distinct peaks at about 34 kHz and 50 kHz, with a strong null (valley) at 37kHz. Note: earlier versions may have identified these as BW39V; once the data was corrected for the frequency response of the hydrophone, the null was found to be at 37kHz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeak: 70kHz\nNull: NA\nIPI: 0.12\nPPS: 8\nBW70 template (cyan) shows a peak at 70 kHz. Slope to the left of the peak is steeper than to the right. Upsweep in the Wigner plot. [Source is SIO, Baumann & Pickering pers. comm., GofCA4A4_051217_234230.x_1114.wav]\n\n\n\n\n\nPeak: 60-65 kHz\nNull: NA\nIPI: 0.127\nPPS: 8\nVery long click with very long frequency sweep and a peak frequency of about 60-65 kHz. Signals may come from above the hydrophones.\n\n\n\n\nPeak: ~26kHz\nNull: NA\nIPI: 0.27-0.40s\nPPS: 3-4\nPulses are low-frequency, with peak at ~26 kHz.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWas above hydrophone. May be alternate part of the beam pattern of a BW46. Wigners were variable and odd looking. Some were almost circular. Need to look for others.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe M. densitrostris, but no evidence of an upsweep and signal was relatively short.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-frequency click, typically &lt; 12 kHz peak. IPI= 0.4-1.0, PPS=1-2."
