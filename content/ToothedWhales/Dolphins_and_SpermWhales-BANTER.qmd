## Methods Summary

-   Pamguard v.2.02 is used to run standard detector settings agreed upon by NMFS acoustics partners at Southwest, Northeast Fisheries Science Centers, and includes click, whistle and burst pulse detectors.Â 

-   Acoustic data is decimated to 192 kHz

-   Multiple click classifiers are applied within the click detector module (digital pre-filter 1 kHz, threshold = 15 dB), 2 distinct whistle detectors are applied on data decimated at 48 kHz and 192 kHz, and burse pulses are detected from data decimated to 192 kHz using the cepstrum and whistle and moan modules

-   Events and species ID are manually defined in Pamguard Viewer

-   PAMpal is used to calculate features of click detections in each event
