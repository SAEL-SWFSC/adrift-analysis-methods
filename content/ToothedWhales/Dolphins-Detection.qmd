title: Sperm Whales
---

## Methods Summary

-   [Triton software](https://github.com/MarineBioAcousticsRC/Triton) is used for the following:

    -   Acoustic data is decimated to 48 kHz sample rate

    -   Long-term spectral averages (LTSAs) are calculated with a X Hz, X second resolution

    -   The start and end times of sperm whale echolocation clicks are identified by manually scanning LTSAs in 1 hour windows

    -   Identify periods of vessel noise or buoy self-noise which could mask sperm whale echolocation

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Decimation of acoustic data

### Generate Long Term Spectral Average (LTSA) 

### Manually log sperm whale acoustic events

### Identify potential masking for sperm whale echolocation 

##Add sub-section about IPI/ICI analysis (not useful for duty-cycled data; Could be useful to apply on continuous data)
