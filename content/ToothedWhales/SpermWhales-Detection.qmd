## Methods Summary

-   [Triton software](https://github.com/MarineBioAcousticsRC/Triton) is used for the following:

    -   Acoustic data is decimated to 48 kHz sample rate

    -   Long-term spectral averages (LTSAs) are calculated with a X Hz, X second resolution

    -   The start and end times of sperm whale echolocation clicks are identified by manually scanning LTSAs in 1 hour windows

    -   Identify periods of vessel noise or buoy self-noise which could mask sperm whale echolocation

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Decimation of acoustic data

Most ADRIFT acoustic data is recorded at sampling rates of 384 kHz, however sperm whale echolocation clicks contain energy between 400 Hz to 30 kHz. To reduce processing time and data storage requirements, full bandwidth data is decimated to a sample rate of 48 kHz using a decimation factor of 8 (384,000/48,000=8).

1.  Using the Tools menu in the Triton "Control" window, choose to decimate an entire folder of WAV files

2.  You will be prompted to choose a folder of WAV files, and then define the appropriate decimation factor. For example, to decimate from 384 kHz to 48 kHz, use a decimation factor of 8.

3.  Then define a folder to save the new, decimated WAV files.

4.  The decimation process will start automatically and show a progress bar. When the decimation is complete, the progress bar will disappear. Depending on the total number of files and the required decimation factor, this process may take a few hours.

### Generate Long Term Spectral Average (LTSA) 

### Manually log sperm whale acoustic events

### Identify potential masking for sperm whale echolocation
