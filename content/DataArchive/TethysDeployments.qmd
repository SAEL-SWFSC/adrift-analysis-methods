## Create deployment worksheet

-   Combine deployment details with GPS data in Tethys format

-   Follow guidelines on the [TethysSAEL repository](https://github.com/asimonis/TethysSAEL/blob/main/R/Create_Deployment_Worksheet.R) on Anne's github (requires inputs from deployment details worksheet and GPS csv files)

## Deployment details to Tethys

-   Upload finalized deployment details to Tethys using appropriate sourcemap

    -   Mobile and moored deployment sourcemaps in [TethysSAEL repository](https://github.com/asimonis/TethysSAEL/tree/main/Source%20Maps) on Anne's github

-   Work with Anne for this 

## PAMpal/Tethys Metadata

-   Talk w/ Taiki about how to enter/store this metadata (we discussed having a function that saves it to a csv so it can be uploaded to Pampal and Tethys). This will include info needed for Passive Packer. 

-   Additional comments on workflow spreadsheet
