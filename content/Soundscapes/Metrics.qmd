-   Aligning methods to SanctSound protocols (<https://sanctsound.ioos.us/>)Â 

-   Data is decimated to 48 kHz

-   Triton vXXX software (<https://github.com/MarineBioAcousticsRC/Triton>) with Soundscape Remora used to calculate long-term spectral averages with 1 Hz, 1 second resolution.

-   Third-octave, octave, and broadband sound pressure levels are calculated in 2 minute windows from 100-24000 Hz.

-   Vessels are acoustically detected automatically or manually
