title: Gray & Humpback Whales - Detection

## PAMGuard

### Array

Depending on the drift that was process the array settings in Pamguard were updated to reflect the spacing between hydrophones and the hydrophone sensitivity. For our purposes we only used CH0 in Pamguard to run the detector.

### Decimation

-   For humpback and gray whales we decimated files to 10kHz (Figure X.) and used a Butterworth Low Pass Filter of 5kHz (Figure x).

### GPL Settings

We started with basic GPL settings from Tyler Helble's PARM files and modified them to fit our data.
