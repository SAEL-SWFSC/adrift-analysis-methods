## Decimation for Baleen Whales

-   In order to save space and processing time, raw wav files were decimated to both 12kHz and 500Hz using Triton Software. A few drifts were decimated to 16kHz due to an original sample rate of 256Hz, this is reflected in the folder name of that decimated drift.

    -   Channel one was selected for decimation because typically channel one on most of our arrays consists of an HTI-92 WB hydrophone. Channel two is typically an HTI-99 HF hydrophone and used for higher frequencies.

-   From those decimated recordings, an LTSA was created for each Drift at both 12kHz and 500Hz respectively.

    -   LTSAs were reviewed by an experienced analyst as an initial QAQC of our recordings in that frequency range. If it was determined that the recordings were unusable in a specific frequency then that was noted in the Deployment Details.
