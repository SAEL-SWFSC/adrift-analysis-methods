## PAMGuard

\*To view the Pamguard settings files used for each drift please click [here](https://github.com/chomweaver/Pamguard_Settings_Files).

### Array

Depending on the drift that was processed the array settings in Pamguard were updated to reflect the spacing between hydrophones and the hydrophone sensitivity. For our purposes we only used CH0 in Pamguard to run the detector. To view the Array Configuration files for each drift please click here\* (insert link to storage place)

### Decimation

#### Fin Whales

#### Blue Whales

#### Minke Whales

#### Brydes & Fin Whales (40 Hz)

#### Humpback & Gray Whales

-   For humpback and gray whales we decimated files to 10kHz (Figure X.) and used a Butterworth Low Pass Filter of 5kHz (Figure x).

### GPL Settings

-   We started with basic GPL settings from Tyler Helble's PARM files and modified them to fit our data
-   We tested modified settings on clips that contained our species of interest until we were happy with the detectors performance
-   We then processed an entire drift's recordings and looked at the detector's performance in Pamguard Viewer Mode by spot checking that calls were being picked up by the detector
-   Once we were satisfied that the detector was doing it's job, we processed the rest of the drifts
-   For this detector, our aim was to over-detect and then sort out the differences using a classifier

#### Blue Whales

#### Minke Whales

#### Brydes & Fin Whales (40 Hz)

#### Humpback & Gray Whales

### Detection Group Localizer Settings

-   In order for PAMpal to interact with the GPL detections we added in the Detection Grouper Module. This allows PAMpal to create events and push them back in the SQLite database in PAMGuard.

    ![Figure x. Detection Grouper Annotation Settings](Screenshots/Detection_Grouper_Annotation_Settings_PG.JPG)

-   It is important to note that both the "Text" and "User Form" annotation boxes must be selected here.

    -   To setup the user form annotation (click on the gear icon)

    -   Create new user form

    -   Label the form "evType" then click ok (see figure X)

        ![Figure x. Adding in a user form for the Detection Grouper in Pamguard](Screenshots/Adding_user_form_to_DGL.JPG)

    -   Next click "edit form"

    -   Add a lookup table and fill it out exactly as follows (see figure x.)

        -   Title: eventType

        -   PostTitle: eventType

        -   DbTitle: eventType

        -   Topic: DGEventType

            ![Figure x. Editing the user form for the detection grouper to work with the GPL detections](Screenshots/User_form_lookup_for_DGL.png)

    -   Add selection drop down by right clicking on '= no selection =' and selecting 'Edit list'

        ![](images/paste-84EC9657.png)

    -   Click 'Add item' and fill in species specific options

        -   In the future we can list the drop down options for each species so they are uniform across analysts

        ![](images/paste-332E165A.png)

    -   Click 'Ok' to close all of the tabs and return to Pamguard Viewer window

-   Next, set up the Spectrogram Annotation

    -   Go to File \> Add Modules \> Utilities \> Spectrogram Annotation

        ![](images/paste-7099FC71.png)

    -   Under 'Settings', go to Spectrogram Annotation settings and click on the gear icon next to 'User form annotation'

    -   Click on the 'User form' drop down, select 'UDF_evType', and click Ok to return to the Pamguard Viewer window

        ![](images/paste-C1DA1020.png)

-   Right click on the spectrogram and go to Settings

    -   Ensure both the 'Detection Grouper' and 'Spectrogram Annotation' boxes are checked and click Ok

        ![](images/paste-C82ACEBF.png)

-   Go to File \> Save Data and close Pamguard

### PAMGuard Output

-   All detections were saved to the binary files and all other data were saved to a SQLite database

## 

## PAMpal

-   The data were then imported into PAMpal and events were created and put back into the PAMGuard database. Events were defined as 6 minute periods of continuous recordings for ADRIFT and 2 minutes for the CCES 2018 data set (limited to duty cycle 2 on 18 off) . \*Add in PASCAL when we get to it.

## Stratified Sub-sampling

-   Due to the nature of this large data set we decided to use a stratified sub-sampling method to randomly sample 20% of all events for validation.

-   \*Add in Kaitlin's code

## Validation

-   \*Kaitlin to add in methods here
