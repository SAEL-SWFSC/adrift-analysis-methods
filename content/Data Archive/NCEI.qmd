## NCEI Passive Packer Metadata

### Disclaimer

Most of the following information can be found in the Passive Packer Manual. This information is summarized from the manual with ADRIFT specific directions for various Passive Packer guidelines and fields. The following steps were put together using Passive Packer v.4.0.2.

### Hard Drive Requirements

#### Guidelines

-   Only use Western Digital or Seagate Drives

    -   We bought 4 20TB [WD Elements Desktop Hard Drives](https://www.westerndigital.com/products/external-drives/wd-elements-desktop-usb-3-0-hdd#WDBWLG0200HBK-NESN) for PASCAL, CCES, and ADRIFT

-   Data can be packaged directly from its home directory to the destination external hard drive

-   All data and the metadata files created by Passive Packer must fit on the destination drive, ensure there is ample space on drive to reduce the risk of the program crashing

#### External Hard Drive Name

Include the organization and project name without spaces in the hard drive name

-   Example: SWFSC_ADRIFT_DRIVE

#### Physical Hard Drive Label

Label drive with the following information easily visible

-   Packagers full name

-   Your organization

-   Project Name

-   Example: Kourtney Burger, SWFSC, ADRIFT

### Passive Packer and Tethys

The goal is to automate the Passive Packer process as much as possible. Currently, these guidelines will help with manual data entry.

#### Future Plan

-   Try exporting Tethys queries and import data into Passive Packer

-   Modify Anne's Tethys deployment spreadsheet script to pull necessary data from deployment details and import it to Passive Packer database. This will auto-fill most fields when Passive Packer is opened, allowing for less manual entry. 

### Getting Started

-   Download software from [Passive Packer Website](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passivepacker) and follow the 'Getting Started' directions

-   See [Passive Packer Manual](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/pad/packager_manual.pdf) for introduction to software and guidelines on packaging other passive acoustics data, including detections and moored deployments

-   Note: The majority of the information required by Passive Packer can be found in the [Deployment Details spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bxlwfVOe1LFfj69B_YddxcA0V14m7codYwgD2YncFk/edit#gid=395545420)
