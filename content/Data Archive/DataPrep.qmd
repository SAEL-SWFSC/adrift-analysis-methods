## Complete data entries

-   Check that all columns in the [Deployment Details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bxlwfVOe1LFfj69B_YddxcA0V14m7codYwgD2YncFk/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet are completed
-   Reach out to deployment/retrieval team for additional deployment details if needed

## SUD File Extraction

Extract SUD files using the [Soundtrap Host Software](https://www.oceaninstruments.co.nz/downloads/)

-   Open the Soundtrap Host Software and navigate to Tools \> Set Default File Save Location
-   Browse to the folder where the SUD files are saved and select it
-   Navigate again to Tools \> File Extraction
-   Click Select File, navigate to the SUD file folder, select all, and click open
-   SUD file extraction will begin, take note of the number of files and ensure this is equal to the number of extracted files once the process is completed

## Generate Full Bandwidth LTSA

Using [Triton on Matlab](https://www.cetus.ucsd.edu/technologies_triton.html), generate a full bandwidth LTSA with the wav files from the SUD files previously extracted

-   Open Matlab and type Triton into the command window
-   Three Triton windows will open, using the Control window, navigate to Tools \> Make LTSA from Directory of Files
-   Select File Type pop up will open, select 1 for wav files (enter 2 or 3 if working with other sound file type)
-   Using the file explorer pop up, navigate to folder where wav files are stored and click Select Folder
-   The Set Long-Term Spectrogram Parameters window will open, set the Time Average Length to 5 seconds and the Frequency Bin Size to 200 Hz, press enter
-   The Choose Channel to LTSA window will open, select 1 and press OK
-   The Save LTSA File window will open, navigate to desired folder, name the output file using this format: ADRIFT\_###\_5s_200Hz.ltsa, and press save
-   The LTSA will begin to process and will automatically open in the plot window once completed

## Identify Recording Data Start and Data End

-   Using the LTSA, identify when the data starts in the recordings (usually determined by when there is no ship noise from the deployment present in LTSA)
-   Identify when the data ends in the LTSA (right before retrieval ship noise is present)
-   Truncate the data by deleting the recordings outside of that time range

## Update deployment detailsÂ 

-   Input Data Start and Data End times into the [Deployment Details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bxlwfVOe1LFfj69B_YddxcA0V14m7codYwgD2YncFk/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet using the Data Start/End times determined above
