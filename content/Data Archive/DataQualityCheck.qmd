-   Data Quality Check

    -   Quality check for errors in the Deployment Details spreadsheet (hydrophone, array, recorder, GPS, dates, etc.)

-   Check recording UTC vs local time

    -   Check Soundtrap Recording time (UTC vs Local Time), fix if needed

    -   Check Taiki\'s script

    -   Rename if on local time

-   Assess data quality (deployment details)

    -   Scan LTSA and define overall deployment as good, compromised, or unusable

-   Run data check on GPS data

    -   Part of Driftwatch

    -   Look at the image that is associated with the drift, make sure it is actually a drifting buoy for the time

-   Run recording QAQC 

    -   soundtrapQAQC function in PAMmisc

    -   Matlab QAQC script

    -   Make an rmd that runs this 

-   Scan LTSA for noisy data

    -   Split between Anne and Cory, elaborate that we only need to look at compromised data
