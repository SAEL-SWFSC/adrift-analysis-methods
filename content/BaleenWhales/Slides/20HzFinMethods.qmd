## Detecting 20Hz fin pulses in PAMGuard {.smaller}

-   Currently we are using PAMGuard version 2.02.09.
-   We used the click detector to identify fin pulses and classify them at 20Hz "clicks"

## Step 1: Open PAMGuard {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
-   Open PAMgaurd and navigate to the [settings file](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/adrift-analysis-methods/tree/main/content/BaleenWhales/Pamguard%20Settings) that has "FinClick" in the name

## Step 2: Change output settings for your Drift {.smaller}

-   Load a new database with the following naming structure

    -   *ADRIFT\_###\_PG_2_02_09_FinClick.sqlite3*

-   Setup a new Binary files folder

    -   We want each Drift to have it's own Binary files

## Step 3: Update the Array File {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
-   Open Hydrophone array settings

    -   Modify settings to match deployment details for the specific array used for your drift

## Step 4: Decimator Settings {.smaller}

-   Check to see that your decimator settings match the settings below

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](/content/Slides/images/Decimator_filter_settings.JPG){fig-align="right"}
:::

## Step 5: Sound Acquisition {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Navigate to your sound files

    -   We used 12kHz files, which were previously decimated in Triton Software

-   Due to an offset at the beginning of the SoundTrap wav files, we need to make sure to skip the initial 3 seconds of the recording

-   Your settings should look like the following below
