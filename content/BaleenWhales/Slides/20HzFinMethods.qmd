## Detecting 20Hz fin pulses in PAMGuard {.smaller}

-   Currently we are using PAMGuard version 2.02.09.
-   We used the click detector to identify fin pulses and classify them at 20Hz "clicks"

## Step 1: Open PAMGuard {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Open PAMgaurd and navigate to the [settings file](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/adrift-analysis-methods/tree/main/content/BaleenWhales/Pamguard%20Settings) that has "FinClick" in the name

## Step 2: Change output settings for your Drift {.smaller}

::: columns 
::: {.column width="40%"} 
- Load a new database with the following naming structure

    -   ADRIFT_###_PG_2_02_09_FinClick.sqlite3

-   Setup a new Binary files folder

    -   We want each Drift to have it's own Binary files

## Step 3: Update the  {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Open PAMgaurd and navigate to the [settings file](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/adrift-analysis-methods/tree/main/content/BaleenWhales/Pamguard%20Settings) that has "FinClick" in the name
