## Step 1: Open Matlab and Set the Path {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
-   Currently we are using Matlab 2023a

-   Click on the home tab -\>Environment-\>Set Path

-   Click "Add folder with Subfolders..."

-   Browse to the folder containing Triton-R2020

-   Click "Save" and then "Close
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
![](/content/Slides/images/setpathmatlab.png){fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

## Step 2: Open Triton {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Start Matlab and at the command prompt type 'triton' and press enter to run the application

-   Three windows will be displayed: Plot, Control, & Message...

## Step 3: Add Logger Remora {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   In the control window (upper left hand window) click on 'Remoras' then 'Add Remora."

-   Browse to the folder containing Triton-\>Remoras-\>Logger. Highlight this folder and click 'Select Folder'

-   A new window pop up asking to restart Triton, click 'Yes'

-   You will only need to add the Remora once. Triton should remember this once you have added it. It will prompt you to restart Triton at this time.

## Step 4: Open an LTSA {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
-   Click File-\>Open LTSA

-   Browse to the LTSA you wish to use for your log (they may vary depending on the species you are logging). Blue and Fin whales were logged using 500Hz LTSAs

-   When it opens the plot and control windows may look something like this

## Step 5: Set Parameters {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   If you are logging duty cycled data you will want to be looking at around 1 hour at a time. Set the plot length accordingly.

-   If you are logging continuous data then plot length should be 1

-   Make sure you start logging as close to the start of the hour as possible

-   Brightness should be from 0-10dB

-   Contrast should be around 100dB

-   Depending on the species you will want to adjust your upper frequency bounds.

    -   For blue and fin whales you can look at 0-150Hz

## Step 6: Create a New Log {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Click on Remoras-\>Log-\>New Log

-   Enter in the name of the log and direct Triton to save it in the folder with the LTSA

-   Name your log with the Cruise_Year_Drift\_#\_Species_Log

    -   Ex: CCES_2018_Drift_07_BlueWhale_Log

## Step 7: Set the deployment metadata {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Type your initials in the 'User ID' tab

-   Type the project name in the 'Project' tab

-   Type in the Drift number in "Deployment' and 'Site' tabs

-   Then select your start time on the LTSA.

    -   Remember to make sure to start as close to the hour as possible
    -   Click 'Set deployment metadata'
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](/content/Slides/images/SetMetaData.png){fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

## Step 8: Setting up logging options {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Check 'All' under the logging options

    -   You can double click the "All' button to expand it and check off specific species if you want.

-   Under Granularity select 'binned'

-   Under time in minutes type '60

-   Click 'Set Effort'

    -   NOTE: Although your log is open in the background do not make changes to it. If you need to make a change to your spreadsheet you must end your logging session and then open the spreadsheet to make changes.

## Step 9: Scrolling and looking for calls {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Use the arrows on the LTSA to scroll back and forward in time

-   Look for spikes of energy in the LTSA

    -   These are Blue whale D calls with low frequency noise
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](/content/Slides/images/LookingForCalls.png){fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

## Step 10: Zooming in on a sound {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   When you see a spike of energy that you want to investigate click on the 'Expand' button to open the associated wav file

-   Then click on the part of the LTSA that you want to look at in more detail
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](/content/Slides/images/ExpandingASound.png){fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

## Step 11: Adjust Spectrogram Parameters {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Set the plot length to 120 s. If it wont let you set it that high then use the back arrow to scroll to the beginning of the wav file

-   Set the Plot Freq End to 200 Hz. We are looking for calls generally below 100 Hz.

-   FFT will vary depending on the frequency range you are looking at. For blue and fin whales we will use 512

-   Set %Overlap to 90

-   Brightness should be between 0-10dB

-   Contrast should be around 100%dB

## Now you Triton windows should look something like this

![](/content/Slides/images/TritonSetupComplete.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Step 12: Logging your first sound {.scrollable}

-   Go through each hour of recordings and look for calls made by the species of interest (i.e. blue whale A, B and D calls)

-   We will be binning call types by the hour

-   When you find your first call we you click on the corresponding drop down for group and species

-   Then check off the first call of that type you have seen in that hour

-   Click on the call and then click on "pick start"

-   \*In the comments please note the quality of the call (1-3) followed by the quality of the recordings (G or B). PLEASE SEPARATE USING A "," (comma)

    -   1=low SNR (signal to noise ratio)
    -   2=medium SNR
    -   3=high SNR
    -   G=good and can use auto-detector
    -   B=bad and cannot use auto-detector

-   Click log to save the information to the spreadsheet

    -   \*See more on this on following slides

## Unsure about the species or call type?

-   Listen to the sound. Does is sound like the call type you are logging?

-   Check in with Cory or Shannon. If they are busy or aren't sure of the call type either then...

-   Save the image and audio

-   In the comments box type "poss call type" (ie poss B call) after the SNR of the call and the G/B recording. Separate these using a comma. We will review these later

    -   Ie : 3, G, poss B call
