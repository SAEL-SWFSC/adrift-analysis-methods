title: Blue Whales - Manual Detection

## Logging A, B and D calls in the LTSA

-   Due to the low frequency noise that persisted under 50Hz throughout most of the drifts, manual logging of calls was the easiest option to bin blue whale vocalizations.

-   Triton software was used to create and manually bin blue whale A,B and D calls into 60 minute bins.

    -   Logging methods can be found [here](Slides/methodsforloggingbaleenwhales.qmd).

-   Logs were saved in excel and then compiled using R into one final worksheet.

-   R was then used to bin blue whale presence into hourly presence plots
